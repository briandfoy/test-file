Revision history for Perl module Test::File

1.443 2017-04-17T08:41:35Z
	* Found another relative path require issue thanks to Ryan Voots 
	http://blogs.perl.org/users/ryan_voots/2017/04/trials-and-troubles-with-changing-inc.html

	removal of . from @INC.

1.27 - 2009-05-21
    * Fix to the tests for 1.26 which didn't account for an
    extra setup test.

1.26 - 2009-05-15
    Don't create man pages for the module (RT #45977)

1.25_001 - 2008-07-15
    * Adding some symlink features, more later
    * Refactoring and separating many tests - test coverage at 90% now
    * This is really a test release for my new Module::Release

1.25 - 2008-06-10
    * Same as 1.24_03, but with a user release version number. The
    new features are the ones in 1.24, but this time the tests
    should all pass :)

1.24_03 - 2008-05-25
    * Make some adjustments in checking the error messages in
    test_files.t to make them work across platforms
    * Remove links.t from the distribution. It doesn't really
    test anything yet.

1.24_02 - 2008-05-25
    * Add a binmode before writing to files so they come out right
    on Windows. Stupid rookie mistake. :(

1.24_01 - 2008-05-24
    * Trial version to fix test ordering problem in 1.24
    * Removed setup.t, which turned into setup_common but wasn't updated
    for the new features in 1.24 (so files were missing in other test
    files)

1.24 - 2008-05-20
    * David Wheeler sent a patch to add file_line_count_is, so
    I also added file_line_count_isnt and file_line_count_between.
    * There aren't any other improvements, so you don't need to
    upgrade unless you want the new functions.

1.23 - 2008-04-23
    * [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is now fail if the owner or
    group does not exist.

1.22_01 - 2008-04-20
    * [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is were passing with non-existent
    users and groups. Now I check the arguments to see if they
    actually exist before I test. This is a developer release to let
    CPAN Testers take a whack at it first.

1.22 - 2007-10-31
    * fixed problem with file path separators in t/rt/30346.t
    * no need to upgrade if you were already able to install this

1.21 - 2007-10-30
    * Fix RT #30346 ( file_not_empty_ok passes if file doesn't exist)
    * require 5.006 from now on

1.19 - 2007-10-27
    * distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.18 - 2007-01-09
    * updated copyright and license info
    * no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.17 - 2006-11-24
    * Updated tests for Test::More 0.65's change in error reporting
    * Added LICENSE field to docs
    * No need to upgrade it you already have this installed

1.16 - 2006-07-08
    * updated the plan for links.t to have the right number of tests
    * no need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.15 - 2006-05-17
    * Updated the distro for copyright and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.14 - 2006-03-08
    * Added Dylan Martin's test for group_is and group_isnt
    * No need to upgrade unless you need these features

1.13 - 2005-12-31
    * You need the latest Test::Builder::Tester (0.32 right now) to get
    the owner.t test to pass. I've noted that in the PREREQ_PM.
    * You don't need to upgrade if you already have Test::File
    installed. If you run into a test problem, ensure you have
    the latest Test::Builder::Tester and try again.

1.12 - 2005-12-25
    * Added the tests owner_is() and owner_isnt() from Dylan Martin

1.11 - 2005-10-02
    * Some strings were mistakenly single-quoted. I meant to interpolate but
    didn't use double quotes. Should I lose my Perl license? :)
	* Upgrade to get the interpolated error messages.

1.10 - 2005-06-05
    * Fixed Windows testing with patch from Tom Metro. Now that I have a
    Windows box, I don't need to guess on some of this stuff.
    * There is a minor code change, but you don't need to rush to upgrade
    if you already have an installed version.

1.09 - 2005-03-08
    * Added POD coverage tests: no need to upgrade

1.08 - 2005-01-06
    * added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the
    platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
    and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

    * Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
    those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
    on a Windows machine.

1.07 - 2005-01-03
    Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
    funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
    files by their mode.

1.06 - 2004-09-05
    * Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root privileges, which
    don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - 2004-09-02
    * fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
    * cleaned up the distribution a bit
    * You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

0.9 - 2004-07-04
    * ported tests to Test::More
    * cleaned up dist files, especially Makefile.PL
    * fixed up some doc issues in File.pm
    * no change in functionality
