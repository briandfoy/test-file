Revision history for Perl module Test::File

1.992 2022-02-15T19:40:16Z
	* GitHub #29 - race condition in tests for mtime, from Slaven Rezić.
	Most people never experienced this timing issue, so if you have this
	already you don't need to update.

1.991 2022-01-21T01:37:36Z
	* Enforce text files in some functions, as warned in #18.
	* Change up some diag messages: 1) lowercase first letter 2) not ! at
	end, and 3) use "file" instead of "filename". If you were matching on
	those, you may need to update your patterns.

1.448 2021-03-05T15:01:18Z
	* Promote to a user release

1.447_01 2021-03-02T16:11:23Z
	* Try handling all-numeric user and group names (but, also, wtf?)
	Github #26.

1.447 2021-02-24T21:32:41Z
	* Trying harder to get the tests to pass on Cygwin

1.446 2021-02-20T21:18:48Z
	* Better cygwin detection, from Achim Gratz

1.445 2021-02-16T08:57:34Z
	* Get the tests to pass under Cygwin (Github #17, from Slaven Rezić)

1.444 2021-01-06T03:40:19Z
	* Remove Travis, add GitHub actions
	* Add file_is_symlink_not_ok

1.443_03 2020-06-15T13:13:42Z
	* Merge some test additions from Desmond Daignault (GitHub #20)

1.443_02 2020-06-15T12:10:34Z
	* Deprecated directories in tests appropriate for only plain files.
	It's a diag() message now but will be a test failure later.

1.443_01 2020-06-12T11:54:41Z
	* change the file_writeable_ok tests to file_writable_ok, which
	is the correct spelling. The old names work but now warn to use
	the new name.
	* Some updates to refresh the tests.
	* Start mirroring Test2::Tools::File so we support the same names.
	Thanks to Torbjørn Lindahl for spotting rough edges.

1.443 2017-04-17T08:41:35Z
	* Found another relative path require issue thanks to Ryan Voots
	http://blogs.perl.org/users/ryan_voots/2017/04/trials-and-troubles-with-changing-inc.html
	* This is another attempt at avoiding failures from the v5.26
	removal of . from @INC.

1.442 2016-09-22T15:35:50Z
	* Update to stable release. This fixes an upcoming Perl @INC
	issue that removes the current directory from the default list.
	This affects only the test files which use a private library.
	If you already have this installed you don't need to update.

1.441_01 2016-09-19T21:44:45Z
	* Fix for missing . in @INC (Github #14 https://github.com/briandfoy/test-file/issues/14)
	This relates to CVE-2016-1238

1.44 2015-07-06T00:29:56Z
	* Fix file_has_* tests to work on Windows (RJBS) GitHub #13

1.25_001 - 2008-07-15
    * Adding some symlink features, more later
    * Refactoring and separating many tests - test coverage at 90% now
    * This is really a test release for my new Module::Release

1.25 - 2008-06-10
    * Same as 1.24_03, but with a user release version number. The
    new features are the ones in 1.24, but this time the tests
    should all pass :)

1.24_03 - 2008-05-25
    * Make some adjustments in checking the error messages in
    test_files.t to make them work across platforms
    * Remove links.t from the distribution. It doesn't really
    test anything yet.

1.24_02 - 2008-05-25
    * Add a binmode before writing to files so they come out right
    on Windows. Stupid rookie mistake. :(

1.24_01 - 2008-05-24
    * Trial version to fix test ordering problem in 1.24
    * Removed setup.t, which turned into setup_common but wasn't updated
    for the new features in 1.24 (so files were missing in other test
    files)

1.24 - 2008-05-20
    * David Wheeler sent a patch to add file_line_count_is, so
    I also added file_line_count_isnt and file_line_count_between.
    * There aren't any other improvements, so you don't need to
    upgrade unless you want the new functions.

1.23 - 2008-04-23
    * [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is now fail if the owner or
    group does not exist.

1.22_01 - 2008-04-20
    * [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is were passing with non-existent
    users and groups. Now I check the arguments to see if they
    actually exist before I test. This is a developer release to let
    CPAN Testers take a whack at it first.

1.22 - 2007-10-31
    * fixed problem with file path separators in t/rt/30346.t
    * no need to upgrade if you were already able to install this

1.21 - 2007-10-30
    * Fix RT #30346 ( file_not_empty_ok passes if file doesn't exist)
    * require 5.006 from now on

1.19 - 2007-10-27
    * distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.18 - 2007-01-09
    * updated copyright and license info
    * no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.17 - 2006-11-24
    * Updated tests for Test::More 0.65's change in error reporting
    * Added LICENSE field to docs
    * No need to upgrade it you already have this installed

1.16 - 2006-07-08
    * updated the plan for links.t to have the right number of tests
    * no need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.15 - 2006-05-17
    * Updated the distro for copyright and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.14 - 2006-03-08
    * Added Dylan Martin's test for group_is and group_isnt
    * No need to upgrade unless you need these features

1.13 - 2005-12-31
    * You need the latest Test::Builder::Tester (0.32 right now) to get
    the owner.t test to pass. I've noted that in the PREREQ_PM.
    * You don't need to upgrade if you already have Test::File
    installed. If you run into a test problem, ensure you have
    the latest Test::Builder::Tester and try again.

1.12 - 2005-12-25
    * Added the tests owner_is() and owner_isnt() from Dylan Martin

1.11 - 2005-10-02
    * Some strings were mistakenly single-quoted. I meant to interpolate but
    didn't use double quotes. Should I lose my Perl license? :)
	* Upgrade to get the interpolated error messages.

1.10 - 2005-06-05
    * Fixed Windows testing with patch from Tom Metro. Now that I have a
    Windows box, I don't need to guess on some of this stuff.
    * There is a minor code change, but you don't need to rush to upgrade
    if you already have an installed version.

1.09 - 2005-03-08
    * Added POD coverage tests: no need to upgrade

1.08 - 2005-01-06
    * added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the
    platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
    and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

    * Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
    those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
    on a Windows machine.

1.07 - 2005-01-03
    Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
    funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
    files by their mode.

1.06 - 2004-09-05
    * Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root privileges, which
    don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - 2004-09-02
    * fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
    * cleaned up the distribution a bit
    * You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

    * ported tests to Test::More
    * cleaned up dist files, especially Makefile.PL
    * fixed up some doc issues in File.pm
