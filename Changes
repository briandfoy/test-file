1.09 - Tue Mar  8 17:58:28 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests: no need to upgrade

1.08 - Thu Jan  6 17:36:20 2005
* added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the 
platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

* Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
on a Windows machine.

1.07 - Mon Jan  3 17:12:51 2005
Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
files by their mode.

1.06 - Sun Sep  5 15:59:40 2004
* Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root priveleges, which 
don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - Thu Sep  2 21:27:27 2004
* fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
* cleaned up the distribution a bit
* You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

0.9 - Sun Jul  4 20:34:50 2004
* ported tests to Test::More
* cleaned up dist files, especially Makefile.PL
* fixed up some doc issues in File.pm
* no change in functionality
